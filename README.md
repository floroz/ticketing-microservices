# Ticketing Microservices

## Project Overview

This project is a sophisticated ticketing system built using a microservices architecture, showcasing modern, scalable application design and development practices.

## Architecture and Technology Stack

### Core Architecture

- **Microservices**: Multiple independent services (Auth, Tickets, Orders) each responsible for specific business functionalities.
- **Event-Driven Design**: Inter-service communication via NATS Streaming, ensuring loose coupling and high scalability.
- **Database Per Service**: Implemented to ensure data independence and service autonomy, using MongoDB.

### Key Technologies

- **Kubernetes**: Orchestrates container deployment, scaling, and management.
- **Docker**: Containerizes each service for consistency across environments.
- **TypeScript & Express.js**: Primary languages and frameworks for service development.
- **NATS Streaming**: Facilitates reliable, asynchronous communication between services.
- **MongoDB**: Database solution for persistent data storage, configured with replica sets.
- **Next.js**: Used for the client-side application.

### Infrastructure and DevOps

- **Skaffold**: Facilitates continuous development with Kubernetes.
- **GitHub Actions**: Potential CI/CD pipeline (based on project structure).
- **Ingress-Nginx**: Manages external access to the services.

## System Components

The system comprises several microservices, including:

- Auth Service
- Tickets Service
- Orders Service
- Client (Next.js application)

Each service is independently deployable and scalable, maintaining data consistency through event-based communication.

## Development Approach

This project emphasizes:

- Cloud-native development practices
- Scalable and maintainable code architecture
- Robust testing strategies (using Vitest)
- Efficient inter-service communication
- Secure authentication using JWT

## Notable Features

- **Authentication**: Implements JWT for secure, stateless authentication across services.
- **Transactional Operations**: Uses MongoDB transactions for data consistency.
- **Error Handling**: Custom error handling and middleware for consistent error responses.
- **Environment Flexibility**: Configurable for different environments (development, testing, production).

The architecture and technology choices reflect a commitment to building resilient, scalable systems capable of handling complex business requirements in a distributed environment.
